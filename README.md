# sail
Source code for the Surrogate-Assisted Illumination (SAIL) algorithm, as
described in: 

"Data-Efficient Design Exploration through Surrogate-Assisted Illumination"
to be published in Evolutionary Computation.

Two domains are provided with parameterized and feed forward deformation encodings: 2D airfoils and 3D velomobile shells. To apply SAIL to a new domain only new representation and evaluation functions must be created. More sample domains will be madepublic as their are published. If you are interested in creating a new domain and having trouble, don't hesistate to ask!
